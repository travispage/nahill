Planned for a vibrant intersection between Downtown Calgary and the East Village, the new library aims to fulfill the city‚Äôs vision for a ‚Äútechnologically advanced public space for innovation, research and collaboration.‚Äù
<blockquote>The exterior‚Äôs fritted glass openings are strategically transparent in most public areas as an attempt to encourage pedestrians to enter.</blockquote>
The encapsulation of the existing Light Trail Train is currently underway, and the new Calgary Public Library is expected to be completed in 2018.
